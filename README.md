# NON.CENSE 

[Non.cense](https://noncense.vercel.app/) is an app that allows users to checkout the top banned books in Texas. Let's face it, banning books is an exercise in stupidity and Non.cense seeks to make these books available to anyone with access to the internet.

## Project Spec
[Click here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)

## Abstract 

This project is designed to allow users to view the most banned books in Texas, view book details, and click a link that takes them to an open source library where digital and audio versions are available to borrow for free. The main screen gives users an explanation of the site. Users can navigate to a library page and view all available banned books. Once a user clicks on a particular book, they can decide if they want to borrow a book! 

## Learning Goals

- Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of the following:
    - React
    - Router
    - Asynchronous JavaScript
    - End to end testing with Cypress
    - Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.
- Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.

- Applications must have the following core functionality:
- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list, searching, commenting, etc
- Multiple views handled by Router
- Be deployed using Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service

## WinsAndChallenges

- Successfully created a niche app using React
- Successfully implemented React Router
- Successfully implemented e2e testing with Cypress
- Successfully brought in data from an open API
- Successfully implemented user search filter
- Successfully taught myself Hooks and implemented them in this project 
- Successfully used CSS to make the site responsive to different screen sizes for a phone or tablet



- Using an api that allowed me to create my own dataset was extremely useful but also very time consuming. I also had to do a lot of research to find out which books had been banned most in texas. 

- Would have liked to have more time for styling.
